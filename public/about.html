<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a very interesting woman, who's very hard to understand. A selfless attitude towards anyone whom I come across with. 
  I'm of a very friendly nature and love to be with people who aren't selfish.
  Ambitious can do anything to achieve my aim. I'm of a very competitive nature but love to find good in everything I see. 
  According to me, there are many things that make us depressed or upset, but that doesn't mean that we stop living. 
  In fact, problems are a sign of life. They make us believe that we are living. The only people who have no problems are in cemeteries.
   So we shall be fortunate that we have problems. It enhances our minds. This is the philosophy of my life.</p>

<p>I'm a lover of nature. Rain, moon, clouds, gardens, greenery is all I'm the most attracted towards. I love to be around it.
   I'm a lover of peace, harmony, and prosperity around me. English is my heart. I'm devoted to it.
   I won't have any existence without it. I have completely surrendered myself to it. Writing poems and reading books is my passion.
    About my schedule, so I'm a very punctual fellow, love to have all the work on time and the way I wish to.
